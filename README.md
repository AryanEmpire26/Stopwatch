# Verilog Stopwatch

This repository contains a Verilog implementation of a stopwatch designed for FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) devices. 

## Overview

The stopwatch module is implemented in Verilog HDL and is intended for use on FPGA boards. It provides basic stopwatch functionalities such as start, stop, and reset. This implementation is suitable for educational purposes, prototyping, or as a foundation for more complex FPGA projects.
